# 0.6.0 (2020-03-21)


### Features

* Added env.ROOT cli argument for externals and client too. Moved excessive logging (confirmed that multiple instances of react is not the problem causing the hooks issue). Added externals for client (hardcoded - should really come from buildconstants). ([232a963](https://github.com/enonic/react4xp-npm/commit/232a963d6afe7bd354ef6ee448102830a9863bc6))
